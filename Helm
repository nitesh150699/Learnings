Helm : Package manager
Helm chart : 
bundle of yml files 
Usecase 1:  ( ex . If u want to deploy elastic stack on cluster for collecting logs . As this is a standard We can use already created chart  which contains secret , svc , config etc)
Usecase 2: if u have multiple deployment files with slightest change like docker image name or version. Instead of creating multiple deployment files . Refer those from values.yml
Syntax :  {{ .values.name }}
Usecase 3: we can bundle our yml files into a helm chart while deploying code in different environments. We can simply install those charts with different yml files
Structure:
Mychart/
    Chart.yml - metadata about chart
    Values.yml - values for template files
