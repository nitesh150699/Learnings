- Continous delivery tool for kubernetes cluster based on gitops
    - ArgoCd  is installed in cluster keeps on listening to app configuration in gitops and current config in cluster. It polls and apply if there r changes . It refers git as source of truth . 
        - Out of Sync
        - Synched 
    
Ex: when we change no.of replicas from 3 to 4 in github . It polls the config changes ( by default every 3 mins and apply to cluster )
    
 -  kubernetes manifest can be yml files / helm charts etc. present in gitops repository
 - It also listens to the cluster. And keep track current state and try to get to desired state defined in git.
    - By default it polls 
Git ---> argoCd <--- cluster ( Sync )
